Hi, this is Daniel Stabile, looking at your Assignment A4.

At the end of this document is the output of our testing program and a table indicating
the points for each part. This grading feedback is designed to help you understand 
how you can improve your assignment. The final score will be out of 95 points.
The autograder awards a maximum of 72 points for correctness. The remaining 23
points will be manually awarded for styl and proper control flow (e.g using recursion rather
than only for loops).
